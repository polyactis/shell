##  By default, every pool sends periodic updates to a central
##  condor_collector at UW-Madison with basic information about the
##  status of your pool.  This includes only the number of total
##  machines, the number of jobs submitted, the number of machines
##  running jobs, the hostname of your central manager, and the
##  "COLLECTOR_NAME" specified above.  These updates help us see how
##  Condor is being used around the world.  By default, they will be
##  sent to condor.cs.wisc.edu.  If you don't want these updates sent
##  from your pool, uncomment the following entry:
CONDOR_DEVELOPERS_COLLECTOR = NONE

##  Additional reporting (like that described above) can be sent via
##  email.  By default, it is sent to "condor-admin@cs.wisc.edu".  If
##  you wish to disable this reporting, uncomment this entry.

#2012.4.10 SYSTEM_PERIODIC_HOLD is machine's counterpart of a job's classad "periodic_hold"/"PeriodicHold". similar for SYSTEM_PERIODIC_REMOVE. another similar classad is periodic_release.
# JobStatus 1 is "IDLE". NumJobStarts is how many times the job has been started. Following policy will put an IDLE job that has been started >1 times on hold/remove. The latter situation happens when the slave node's condor_master expires (which evicts/preempts jobs running on it) or the machine goes down.
